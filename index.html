        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <P>I worked on many projects since I started studying in University Of Jeddah.<br> 
            I uploaded some of them on GitHub but not all of them.<br>
        Note: <em><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://github.com/Shahadm99" target="_blank">Click here</a></em> for my GitHub link<br>
        Some of the projects that I have worked on are:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>OOP Level 1: A Movie Ticket Booking System</li>
   <li> OOP Level 2: Programmong/Designing a GUI for A Movie Ticket Booking System</li>
    <li>Software Project Management: Analysing, Creating a charter, and Eastmeating a budget
    for an app called "NearMe" that was initiated by me and 5 other peers of mine. <br>
    The idea of the app is that it helps you locate the closest gas station.<br>
    It also helps to determine whether the station is open or closed<br>
    the availability of a nearby alternative and the presence of a fuel delivery service<br>
    if the vehicle stops somewhere</li> 
    <li>Human Computer Interaction: Used Figma to design " Aufuq" application<br>
    Aufuq is an application that help people book their entire trip using just our app<br>
    They can veiw hotels, flights, activities in their area, and much more.<em> <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="AufuqPresentaion-1.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to view the presentation</a></em></li>
    <li>Airport Database: I worked on designing a simple airport database<br>that is tailored to effectively manage and streamline various operational aspects of airport management.<br> 
        This database is structured to handle information related to airlines, flights, passengers, baggage, airport staff, and other logistical details.</li>
